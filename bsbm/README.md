BSBM for ontop
=============

BSBM A well known benchmark for SPARQL queries. It includes an SQL schema, a
data generator and a set of SPARQL queries. We have created a set of
mappings to be able to tests OBDA systems (e.g., -ontop- and other R2RML
systems). The mappings where created to be able to produce data as that
generated by the data generator for RDF in BSBM.

This folder contains the mappings for the BSBM[1] schema to the BSBM 
vocabulary. The mappings where originally written in the mapping language
for -ontop-, then exported with -ontop- for protege (note, ontop 1.11 has
issues when exporting this file, which where fixed manually). For the
schema and sparql queries 

File list
* bsbm.obda - Mappings for ontop
* BSBM-R2RML.ttl - Export of the .obda file into R2RML in turtle syntax
* BSBM-R2RML.rdf - As before but RDF/XML syntax (through Jena's rdfcat)
* BSBM-R2RML.n3 - As before but N-TRIPLES syntax (through Jena's rdfcat)
