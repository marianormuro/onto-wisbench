=============

This repository contains the data for 2 benchmarks. 

BSBM 
-------------

A well known benchmark for SPARQL queries. It includes an SQL schema, a
data generator and a set of SPARQL queries. We have created a set of
mappings to be able to tests OBDA systems (e.g., -ontop- and other R2RML
systems). The mappings where created to be able to produce data as that
generated by the data generator for RDF in BSBM.

Wisconsin
-------------

The Wisconsin benchmark is a well known benchmark for SQL systems. We have
created a set of queries to evaluate the performance of SQL features that
are commonly used in SPARQL to SQL translations. The Wisconsin folder
contains the files needed to create the tables, generate the data and 
queries for this test.
